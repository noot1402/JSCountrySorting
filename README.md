# JSCountrySorting

This project was realized during our 4th year at ESME, for our javascript class.

The goal of this project was to explore functional programming and the tools and challenges that come with it.

This code compiles many countries and their attributes in json files, and allows you to sort them by your chosen attributes.

There is also an option to pick your 'ideal country' based on settings
